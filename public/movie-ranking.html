<h2>Dayne's Top Movies</h2>
 <h3>1. The Batman (2022) </h3>
<p>
    The reason why this is the greatest movie ever is because this is the best depicted Batman there is.<br />
    He is a lonely, emo night owl (bat) that seems to hate other people. The Ridler might be one of the best <br />
    one screen villians we have seen. It also sets up and includes a lot of other villians as well.
</p>
<h3>2. The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
<p>
    Need I explain more? Now this was my favorite movie up until the Batman came out. Heath Ledger as the <br />
    Joker is undefeated and no one will ever top his performance, but the cinematics and plot does not match <br />
    to The Batman which is why it is second.
</p>
<h3>3. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)</h3>
<p>
    Now this is arguably the best Star Wars movie, although many will say the original trilogy is much better, <br />
    however, the fight scenes and plot that goes down in this movie tops anything that we had seen before. <br />
    No matter what your opinions are on the other two movies in the prequals, it should not carry into this movie. <br />
    This is the greatest Star Wars movie ever.
